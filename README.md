# Red Dead Redemption 2 Fan Page

This website is intended to provide information in different forms about Rockstars game Red Dead Redemption 2 that was released on different platforms in October 2018.
The intention is to provide a simple website that is easy to navigate, that provides information about the game in video, image and text. There's simple navigations, clear contrast between the colors on the webpage and the background.

## Header

The main element that you see when entering the website is a picture designed by Rockstar containing the image of 7 men walking on a row holding guns with the text "Rockstar games presents Red Dead Redemption 2" above them. You'll know immediatly what the website is going to be about. The image sits in the header tag.

## Navigation Bar

<!-- The navigation can be found at the top right of the logo with links to three different pages. The menu is simply constructed with a hover effect to clearly show which button you have the mouse over. 

All pages have the same consistent theme, which makes it easy to see that only the content changes on the page you are on. The menu also makes it easy to navigate back and forth on the pages without having to click the back button.-->

# Pages and Features
## Favicon

<!--  - Used an icon from [Icon 8](https://icons8.com/icons)
- Favicon was created through [Favicon Converter](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)
- The same favicon is used throughout every single page to make it easier for the user to recognize the website if they have other tabs open.-->

## The Expedition

<!-- This page is for the user to be able to read more detailed information about the expedition in compact form. To break up long paragraphs, images are used to give a more relaxed visual impression. -->

## The Gallery

<!-- The gallery consists of a total of four images in a responsive design. The look is meant to give a retro feel with the polaroid frame and descriptive text. The images are also lined up according to the timeline with the first images showing the beginning of the project and the last image showing how the three men were discovered 33 years later after having gone missing. -->

# Testing

<!--  - The website has been tested using the extension "Live Server" throughout the project.
- Dev Tools has been used to check the responsiveness in different screen sizes.
- The project has been tested in different browsers such as Chrome, IE Edge, Firefox, Safari and Opera. The only one not being able to load the page (and completely timed out) was Opera.
- The site has also been deployed to Git Pages and regurlarly been checked for errors. -->

## Bugs

<!--  - Had minor problems with positioning of different elements due to rookie mistakes. Solved by going through Code Institutes previous videos about Positioning and reading up on [W3Schools](https://w3schools.com) about 'Display', 'Positioning' and 'Margin'.
- Had issues with GitHub not being able to show my images properly. Solved this by removing the first "/" in the file name.
- Had issues with navigation bar disappearing when changing screen resolution. Changed 'Overflow: Hidden' to 'Overflow: Visible' instead.
- Jigsaw showed 1 error consisting a faulty Float element. Sorted this out by changing it into 'margin: 0 auto;' instead.
- HTML Validator showed 1 error regarding a script. Easily fixed by putting the script inside the body-tag. -->

## Unfixed Bugs

- <!--Lighthouse issues such as cache control ie.. Did not have time to troubleshoot them due to submission but will look into them the next update. -->

### Navigation links, contact form and gallery

<!-- - Manually tested all navigation links on every page.
- Manually tested opening the site in different browsers.
- Tested to skip filling in the contact form - submit button did not work until I filled in the information properly, hence the 'required' attribute is working.
- Came to the page 'submit.html' when filling in Contact Form and clicking on Submit.
- Gallery - all images are showing and gallery is flexible depending on screen size. -->

## Validator Testing

### HTML - W3C validator

<!-- ![W3C Bug](docs/testing/W3Validator_fixed.png)
No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Frackstorm.github.io%2FCode-Institute_Project-1%2F) the second time. -->

### CSS - Jigsaw Validator

<!-- ![W3C Bug](docs/testing/CSS_fixed.png)
No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Frackstorm.github.io%2FCode-Institute_Project-1%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en) validator the second time. -->

### Lighthouse

![W3C Bug](docs/testing/lighthouse.png)

<!-- - Received score 91/100.

![W3C Bug](docs/testing/lighthouse_issues.png)

### Wave

<!-- Site has been tested at [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://rackstorm.github.io/Code-Institute_Project-1/) with good results. The only alert was that there is a
redundant link to the index.html. This because both the logo and the Home-button shares the same url. -->

# Deployment

## Setting it up

<!-- I have used Code Institute's instructional video on how to deploy my website. I have paused the video and followed the instructions. Text and steps below are copied from Code Institutes instructions on how to deploy the site to GitHub.

**The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:**

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
4. The live link can be found here - <https://rackstorm.github.io/Code-Institute_Project-1/> -->

## Adding, committing and pushing code

<!-- - All code has been pushed to the repository <https://github.com/Rackstorm/Code-Institute_Project-1>
- All code has been regurlary added, committed and pushed throughout the project.
- The commands being used are `git add <file>`,
  `git commit -m “commit message”` and
  `git push`
- Due to being completely brand new into this tech world, the `git commit -m “commit message”` have gradually improved throughout this project since it was difficult for me to understand the importance of good logging in the beginning.-->
